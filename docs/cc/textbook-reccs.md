## Kai Vogelsang's *Introduction to Classical Chinese*

Published in 2021.
Each lesson focuses on teaching a certain aspect of Classical Chinese grammar. This book has a very robust of classifification of verbs. Great book to use as a reference as well.
#### Positives:

- Gives clear and detailed explanations on Classical Chinese grammar and usage of specific words by breaking sentences down into the smallest units possible.
- Machine-readable.
- Many practice excersizes.
- Comes with a Yomitan Dictionary built specifically for this textbook

#### Negatives:
- Excersizes do not have an answer key so you will be forced to ask for help or google the quote for more context if you run into trouble.
- A grammar heavy approach is not for everyone.
- Prefers not translating provided examples.

**It is highly recommended to use the popup Vogelsang dictionary from Yomitan alongside this book, preferably in the Yomitan PDF Viewer**
