Take advantage of the categories, folders, and subfolders we have.</li> <li>Make frequent commits. A \"commit\" (see Submitting your work) is a checkpoint of your changes, so each single \"change\" you make (e.g. adding a page, editing a paragraph, adding a set of dictionaries) should be one commit. When you merge back in, you can merge multiple commits at once, so don't worry about making small, frequent checkpoints.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/contribute/#final-words","title":"Final Words","text":"<ul> <li>See Tutorials for some tutorials walking through different possible use cases and covering the whole process from making an edit using the GitHub web editor, to merging your contribution into the site.
